# Mahanth's Card 
## Summary
#### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? 
I have made a business card that has an nfc chip and an LED, with which a user I have met can scan the NFC chip and the LED will light up. 
It will be used to help me start networking with others and make a good first impression. 

## Plan
#### How much is it going to cost? What is your timeline? 
It will cost $3.73 with shipping (as I have chosen the cheapest shipping option). The timeline included 2 days of developing the PCB and fixing any errors 
and another 1-2 days spent inputting all this information and getting approval. Shipping itself will take around 2-3 weeks. 

## Design
#### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**
The design process was pretty simple as I already knew how to make schematics for circuits through previous school experience. The PCB design
itself was a bit harder as I chose the wrong antenna at first. However, I fixed it through some help, which I got from the Slack!
